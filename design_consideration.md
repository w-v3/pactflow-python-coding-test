### Design Considerations

leveraging an LLMChain as a step within a larger RunnableSequence is a natural and elegant design. This approach allows you to:

Modularize Workflow: Keep the language detection and code review as distinct steps within the sequence.
Reuse LangChain Components: Utilize the powerful abstractions LangChain provides for handling prompts, LLM calls, and output parsing.
Scalability: Easily extend or replace parts of the sequence (e.g., adding preprocessing or integrating new tools).
If you're considering integrating an LLMChain for a specific step like language detection or code review, it's the right approach because it keeps each task focused, while still allowing you to compose them into a broader pipeline using RunnableSequence.


To integrate the LanguageDetector class with the Reviewer class, we need to modify the Reviewer class to include language detection as part of its workflow. This integration will ensure that the code snippet is first analyzed for its programming language and then reviewed accordingly. This enhancement will make the code review process more context-aware by tailoring feedback based on the detected language.
