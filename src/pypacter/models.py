A lower temperature will cause the model to make more likely, but also more
boring and conservative predictions. A high temperature on the other hand will
generate more creative but also more unpredictable outputs.

OpenAI's GPT-4 model.

This model is the most powerful model available in the OpenAI API. It is capable
of ingesting a large amount of text and generating coherent responses. This
model is also the most expensive to use and therefore should be used sparingly.
